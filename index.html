        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
      </center>
      <h3>SmartLight: An IoT-based Buck Converter Solution for Household Lighting Control</h3>
      <p>
        The project, "IoT-controlled SmartLight Buck Converter," is a technologically advanced solution that utilizes
        the
        Internet of Things
        (IoT) to precisely control the brightness of a household light. The team employed the use of a buck converter, a
        widely utilized circuit
        in power electronics, to regulate the output voltage and current of the light, thus allowing for seamless
        adjustment of the light's
        brightness to full, half, and off states.
        The team also conducted extensive simulation and modeling of the circuit design using industry-standard MATLAB
        software to ensure
        optimal functionality and performance. This enabled thorough testing and debugging of the circuit, resulting in
        a
        highly efficient
        and robust product that meets the highest standards of reliability.
        Moreover, the team developed a user-friendly Android app that facilitates remote control of the light, enabling
        convenient and
        effortless operation of the light from any location. This is a perfect solution for those who want to control
        the
        lights remotely
        and easily.
        The project is a testament to the team's engineering expertise and their ability to seamlessly integrate IoT
        technology to enhance
        the functionality and usability of household lighting. It is a solution that is not only practical but also
        provides an unprecedented
        level of convenience and control.
      </p>
      <h3>C++ Console Tic-Tac-Toe: A Two-Player Game</h3>
      <p>
        The project, "C++ Tic-Tac-Toe Game," is a fun and interactive game that was developed using the C++ programming
        language.
        The game is designed for two players and is played on the console displayed on the screen. The objective of the
        game is for
        players to place their respective markers (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three markers in a
        row,
        either
        horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

        The project helped the developer to gain a deeper understanding and familiarity with the C++ language and its
        capabilities.
        The developer was able to implement various C++ concepts such as loops, conditionals, and functions, to create a
        fully functional game.
        Additionally, the developer was able to design a menu on the console, providing a user-friendly interface for
        the
        players to navigate
        and play the game. This skill in creating a menu on the console was also beneficial in my future projects.
        Overall, the project is a great way to learn and practice C++ programming while also having fun. It provides a
        great opportunity to
        improve problem-solving skills and logic while also learning how to create a simple but engaging game.</span>

      <h3>Library Management System: A Comprehensive Solution for Managing Books, Students, and Administrative Tasks
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduction: <br>
          This project endeavors to streamline the manual process of library management through automation. The primary
          objective of this system is to simplify the tasks of adding, modifying, and deleting books, managing user
          accounts, and keeping records of books and users in a seamless manner.</li><br>

        <li>System Requirements: <br>
          The hardware prerequisites for the implementation of this project entail a computer equipped with sufficient
          memory and storage capacity. On the software front, the project requires the C++ programming language and an
          Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code.</li> <br>

        <li> User Requirements: <br>
          The system accommodates two distinct user categories: Admin and Student. The Admin is granted comprehensive
          access to all functionalities, including book and user management, while the Student is only permitted to view
          books and perform book issuance and returns.</li> <br>

        <li> System Design: <br>
          The architecture of the system encompasses several modules, each of which is responsible for executing a
          specific function. These modules include the Login module, Book Management module, User Management module, and
          Issue/Return module. The book information will be persistently stored in a text file.</li> <br>

       <li>Modules:</li> 
        <ul>

          <li> Login Module: <br>
            This component enables users to log into the system by entering their username and password. Upon
            successful authentication, the user will be redirected to the relevant modules based on their role.</li>
          <br>

          <li> Book Management Module: <br>
            The Admin is equipped with the capability to add, modify, and delete books via this
            module. The information regarding books will be stored in a text file and can be retrieved as needed.</li>
          <br>

          <li> User Management Module: <br>
            This module empowers the Admin to add, modify, and delete user accounts. The information
            regarding users will be persistently stored in a text file and can be retrieved as needed.</li> <br>

          <li>
            Issue/Return Module: <br>
            The Student can issue and return books using this module, which also includes a fine
            charging system for late returns.
          </li> <br>

          <li> Password Change Module: This module enables users to alter their password.</li> <br>
        </ul>

        <li>Implementation : <br>
          The system commences with a login screen, where the user is required to enter their username and password.
          Based
          on the user's role, they will be redirected to the appropriate modules. The project aims to optimize the
          library
          management process while utilizing a text file for data storage and ensuring a user-friendly experience.</li>
